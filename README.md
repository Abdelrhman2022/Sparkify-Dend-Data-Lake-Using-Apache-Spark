# Sparkify-Dend-Data-Lake-with-Apache-Spark
In this project, we try to help one music streaming startup, Sparkify, to move their date warehouse to a data lake. Specifically, I bulid an ETF pipline to extract their data from S3 and processes them using Spark, and loads the data into a new S3 as a set of dimensional tables.
